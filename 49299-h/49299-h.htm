<h2><span class="ph4">TO THE</span><br />

<span class="gesperrt ph1">READER</span>.</h2>

<p><i>Good Reader</i>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Having</span> been hitherto
very averse
from Publishing
any of
Dr. <i>Willis</i>'s Posthumous
Works, because it may
be presum'd that they
want his last Hand to
compleat them; and for
that Reason, giving no
ear till now to any Entreaties
of that kind,
though never so powerful,
or never so importunate:
I think my
self oblig'd to give the
World some Account
why I alter'd my mind
as to this particular, and
did at length suffer my
self to be prevail'd with
to Print the following
Treatise, it being
now Fifteen Years after
his Death; and it is
briefly this: A worthy
Friend and an old Acquaintance
of mine, desiring
if I knew of,
or could procure any
choice and approv'd Receipts
against the Plague,
that I would furnish
him with some for a
Friend of his, for the
preservation of whose
Health he had a singular
concern, and who
was going in the late
Embassie to <i>Constantinople</i>,
where that Distemper
then was, and did frequently
rage: I promis'd
to use my utmost
endeavours to supply
him; and calling to
mind this short Tract,
which I transcrib'd from
the Doctor's Papers in
the Year 1666, being
then his <i>Amanuensis</i>; I
knew it would far exceed
whatsoever I could
elsewhere obtain, or pretend
to collect upon
this Subject: Whereupon
I allow'd him to
take a Copy of it for
his Friend's use, upon
condition he would not
make it publick. But
not long since a suspicious
Sickness having
seiz'd their Majesties
Army in <i>Ireland</i>, the
same Person was very
much of opinion, that
the Printing of it might
do great service, should
that Disease prove Pestilential;
and urg'd
such Arguments, as
made me to be also of
the same perswasion;
especially, he having
shew'd the Copy to several
of the most eminent
Physicians amongst
us, whose opinion
it was, as he assur'd
me, that the Publishing
of it might be of
very great use, it being
a charitable instruction
in cases of great
danger, for such as
cannot procure the attendance
of Physicians:
I must needs own, that
I could not withstand
the judgment of such
Persons.</p>

<p>The regard I have always
had, and shall still
have for the Reputation
and Memory of my dear
<i>Master</i>, and best <i>Friend</i>,
will not, I presume, be
thought to lessen, by
my giving way upon
these terms to this Publication;
since it is so
earnestly desir'd, and so
well esteem'd of: And
the Good that is aim'd at
by it can be no ill Apology

<h2><span class="ph2">A Plain and Easie</span><br />

<span class="gesperrt ph1">METHOD, <i>&amp;c.</i></span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> time of <span class="antiqua">Pestilence</span>, because
a Physician cannot
easily, or often, be consulted
with; Therefore it
behoveth all Persons, as well
Poor as Rich, to be furnish'd
with Remedies against that Contagious
Disease; and certain Rules,
or a Method how to use them:
Which Method being very plain,
and almost the same to all
People, consists chiefly in these<span class="pagenum mvright"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
two Parts, <i>viz.</i> <span class="antiqua">How to preserve
the Whole from taking
Infection; And how to
cure the Sick that are infected</span>.</p>

<p>Touching the First; Though
the surest way is to fly from it,
yet in regard this cannot be done
by all, some Means should be
us'd to secure [so far as it is possible]
those that are forced to
stay by it. Such Means of <span class="antiqua">Prevention</span>,
either concern the
Publick Magistrate, which are
already sufficiently known, and
commonly practis'd in all places
that are infected, and it would
be superfluous to repeat them
here; Or else such as belong to
private Persons, what ways every
Man that lives in, or near
an infected place, may arm himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
against the danger of Contagion;
Which should be endeavour'd,
as well by purifying
the Air we breathe, as also by
fortifying our selves against
taking the Infection at our
Nostrils, Mouth, or Pores of
the Body, which are the chiefest,
if not the only parts the Poison
creeps in at.</p>

<p>That the <span class="antiqua">Air</span> we breathe in
may be wholesome, all Things,
that may advance or add to the
corruption of it, should diligently
be removed; our Houses, and
Streets kept clean; all Filth, and
whatever may cause noisom
smells, be taken away; and amongst
other things, the smell of
Sope Suds, and Lye, in the washing
of Clothes, be avoided; this,
Experience has taught to be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
dangerous; as 'tis observed by
<span class="antiqua">Diemerbroek</span> and <span class="antiqua">Vander Heyden</span>.</p>

<p>Besides the suppressing of Vapours
that may increase the infection
of the <span class="antiqua">Air</span>, it is to be
purg'd of that Malignity it brings
with it from other infected places;
and this is done by great
Fires, which should be continually
kept, except the Weather be
too hot, and by Fumes of <i>Sulphur</i>,
<i>Nitre</i>, <i>Frankincense</i>, <i>Pitch</i>,
<i>Rosin</i>, <i>Tarr</i>, and the like, which
every day should be burnt in
the Room we most frequent, also
before our Doors, and on the
tops of our Houses. Of simple
Medicines to be us'd for this purpose,
<i>Brimstone</i> is commended
for the best that is; 'Tis likely
that <i>Vitriol</i>, which partakes much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the like acid Spirit, may be
very proper; but in regard 'tis
not easily combustible, make
this mixture, and strew of
it on Coals in a hot Chafing-dish.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take green</i> Vitriol <i>calcin'd</i>,
Saltpeter, <i>and</i>
Sulphur, <i>of each a
pound, beat them well
together, and keep it for
use</i>.</p>

<p class="hangingindent"><i>In close Rooms, and in hot
Weather</i>, Vinegar <i>with</i> Rue,
<i>or</i> Wormwood, <i>chopt small,
and evaporated in a perfuming
Pot; or else Pestilential</i> Vinegar
[as we shall describe]
<i>thrown on a hot Brick. Or<span class="pagenum smaller1"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
take</i> Myrrh, Galbanum, Ammoniac,
<i>of each half an
Ounce; boyl these in a Quart,
or three Pints of</i> White-Wine
Vinegar, <i>'till they
are all dissolv'd; put half a
spoonful of this at a time
on a hot Brick</i>.</p></div>

<p>Some commend Slakeing of
<i>Lime</i>, supposing the fume that
ariseth from it, may purifie the
Air: 'Tis possible, if this be done
with <i>Vinegar</i>, either simple, or
impregnated with <i>Alexipharmacal</i>
Medicines, it may be more effectual.</p>

<p>Next to the Cure of the <span class="antiqua">Air</span>,
to render that as wholesom as
we can; we must arm our selves
against taking in that Malignity,
which [notwithstanding all means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of purifying it] shall still remain
mixt with it. Now because the
Spirits are commonly the first
that receive Infection; We must
fortifie them, that they may not
easily admit the approaches of
their Enemy, which when they
are in full vigour and expansion,
they will repel, and as it were
keep off at a distance; Therefore
<span class="antiqua">Wine</span> and <span class="antiqua">Confidence</span> are a
good <span class="antiqua">Preservative</span> against the
<span class="antiqua">Plague</span>: But when the Spirits,
through fear, or want of supply,
do recede, and are forc'd
to give back, the Enemy enters,
and first seizeth them, and thence
gets into the Blood and Humors;
Therefore much <span class="antiqua">Fasting</span>
and <span class="antiqua">Emptiness</span> are <span class="antiqua">bad</span>: But
every one should Eat and Drink
at convenient Hours, in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
manner and measure, as may
always keep the Spirits lively
and chearful, and endeavour to
compose his Mind and Affection
against fear and sadness.</p>

<p>But besides keeping the Spirits
in a good height, and more
especially when that cannot be
done, as in Persons that are
naturally fearful, and of a tender
Constitution, the Spirits
should constantly, as it were, be
kept arm'd with such Remedies
as resist the Poyson; that is,
the use of proper Antidotes against
the <span class="antiqua">Plague</span>.</p>

<p>I shall set down some <span class="antiqua">Preservatives</span>
to be taken of every
Morning, and again at Night,
by those that live in infected
places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take of Conserve of</i> Wood-Sorrel
<i>four Ounces</i>;
Confectio Liberans,
<i>and</i> Mithridate, <i>of
each half an Ounce;
Salt of</i> Wormwood
<i>two Drams; Confection
of</i> Hyacinth <i>one Dram</i>;
Tormentil <i>Roots, and
fine</i> Bole, <i>of each half
a Dram; Pestilential</i>
Vinegar <i>half an Ounce;
mix all with Syrup of</i>
Citron; <i>Take as much
as a Nutmeg, Night
and Morning</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>For the Poorer Sort, that Medicine
of the Ancients, may be
proper, <i>viz.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take of</i> Rue <i>two handfuls</i>,
Figs <i>and</i> Walnut-Kernels,
<i>of each twenty
four, common Salt half
an Ounce; Which beat
all together in a Mortar,
till it be well mix'd;
Take of it as much as a
Nutmeg every Morning
and Night</i>.</p></div>

<p>This Medicine may be several
ways advanc'd, by adding some
<i>Alexipharmacal</i> Remedies to it,
as by putting Salt of <i>Wormwood</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
instead of common Salt, and
by adding an Ounce of <i>Venice
Treacle</i>, to the whole Composition.</p>

<p>For those that cannot take an
<i>Electuary</i>, these <i>Tablets</i> may be
proper to eat, about one Dram
at a time, two or three times
a day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take of the Roots of</i> Virginian-Snakeweed,
Zedoary, Contrayerva,
Species Liberans,
<i>of each two
Drams</i>; Camphire
<i>two Drams; mix all
finely pouder'd, then dissolve
eight Ounces of<span class="pagenum smaller2"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fine Sugar in Pestilential</i>
Vinegar; <i>Boyl
it Candy high, and adding
the Pouder to
it, make all into Lozenges</i>.</p></div>

<p>For some that are of a hotter
Constitution, and a high
Sanguine Temper, it may be
proper to take every Morning a
spoonful of Pestilential <i>Vinegar</i> in
a little <i>Carduus</i> water, or plain
<i>Wallnut</i> water; or else drink a
draught of <i>Posset-Drink</i>, made
with a Spoonful of that <i>Vinegar</i>.</p>

<p>Let the <span class="antiqua">Pestilential Vinegar</span>
be made thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take of the Roots of</i> Angelica,
Butter-Burr,
Tormentil, Elecampane,
<i>of each half an Ounce</i>,
Virginian-Snakeweed,
<i>choice</i> Zedoary,
Contrayerva, <i>of
each three Drams;
Leaves of</i> Scordium,
Rue, Goats-Rue, <i>of
each one handful</i>; Marigold
Flowers, Clove-gilloflowers,
<i>of each
half a handful; Seeds
of</i> Citron <i>and</i> Carduus,
<i>of each two Drams;
Cut and bruise these, and<span class="pagenum smaller2"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
put them in a Glass-Bottle,
with three Pints of
the best</i> Vinegar, <i>to
digest for ten days</i>.</p></div>

<p>When the Stomach, by frequent
taking of one sort of
<span class="antiqua">Antidote</span>, begins to loath it:
In such Cases the use of it may
be changed into some other:
And if the Stomach withal should
be ill, and defective, in Appetite
and Digestion; let the Party take
every Morning, ten or twelve
Drops of <span class="antiqua">Elixir Proprietatis</span>,
in plain <i>Wormwood</i> Water, or else
in <i>Wormwood</i> Wine.</p>

<p>Those that have Coughs, and
ill Lungs, may take five or six
Drops of <span class="antiqua">Balsam</span> of <span class="antiqua">Sulphur</span>,
made thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take Flower of</i> Sulphur,
<i>two Ounces, melt it in an
Earthen Dish glaz'd on
the fire, then put to it
two Ounces of Salt of</i>
Wormwood; <i>stir it
for a Quarter of an Hour,
taking care that it does
not catch fire; Then put
into it of</i> Aloes, Myrrh,
Olibanum, <i>finely pouder'd,
of each one Dram,
of</i> Saffron <i>half a Dram;
Keep this stirring half a
Quarter of an Hour;
Take it off, and put half
an Ounce of it pouder'd,<span class="pagenum smaller2"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to digest in five or six
Ounces of good Spirit
of Wine; It will take
in a short time a very
excellent Tincture: Which
keep for use</i>.</p></div>

<p>Or else this Balsam may be
made with <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Spiritus Theriacalis
Camphoratus</i>, and so will be
more effectual against the <span class="antiqua">Plague</span>,
Or which is more applicable to
use,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Put an Ounce of that Pouder
newly made, into a
pretty large Glass, and
put to it a Quart of<span class="pagenum smaller2"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
good Sack; Set it in a
gentle heat, for three or
four Hours, it will take
a Tincture: And of this
one may take half a Spoonful
at a time: And I
suppose two Spoonfuls in
a convenient</i> Vehicle,
<i>may be a good</i> Sudorifick
<i>to be given one that is
infected</i>.</p></div>

<p>Though Purging in time of
Pestilence is not good, as <span class="antiqua">Diemerbroek</span>
by frequent Examples
has observ'd, yet in <i>Cachochymick</i>
Bodies, it may be convenient
once in a fortnight, to take a
Dose of <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pillul&aelig; Ruffi</i>; Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
half a Dram at Night, and next
Morning take the wonted Antidote,
as at other times.</p>

<p>Also for those that live in an
infected Air, that there is suspicion
that they may daily take in some
pestiferous Vapours, which fermenting
with the Blood and
Humours, may insensibly at last
break out in the <span class="antiqua">Plague</span>; it
may not be amiss, once or
twice a week, to take pretty
large <span class="antiqua">Sweats</span> in their Beds:
And this to be done, especially
if the Party has had any occasion
whereby he may suspect himself
to have been more open to
infection, or that he has taken any:
After such Sweat he should keep
his Chamber the forepart of the
day, till the Pores are reduc'd to
be as they were before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>To provoke such a Sweat:
Take of</i> Venice Treacle,
<i>one Dram; dissolve
it in three Ounces of</i>
Carduus <i>Water, add
a Spoonful of</i> Syrup
<i>of Pestilential</i> Vinegar;
<i>Or take a Draught of
Posset-Drink, made with
Pestilential</i> Vinegar;
<i>In which boyl a few</i> Petasitis
<i>Roots: To promote
and continue the
Sweat, take Posset-Drink
with</i> Meadow-Sweet,
<i>or else with</i> Carduus,
<i>or</i> Marigold-Flowers
<i>boyl'd in it</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the daily and constant
life of such <i>Alexipharmacal</i> Remedies,
there are other Means,
which occasionally and sometimes
continually should be taken.
For in regard we always draw
in the Air at our Nostrils and
Mouth, these parts should be
well guarded with some Antidotes,
that may keep out the poysonous
Vapours from entring in,
and especially as often as upon occasion
we are more nearly expos'd
to danger of Infection. To this
end, some things to smell to, others
to be held in the Mouth,
chew'd, and swallow'd down, are
frequently to be insisted on.</p>

<p>That which seems at once to fulfil
most of these intentions, is taking
of Tobacco in a Pipe; the Smoke
of this secures those parts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
lye openest, and at once intercepts
the Contagion from the
Brain, Lungs, and Stomach: Nay
more than this, it stirs the Blood
and Spirits all the Body over, and
makes them shake off any poysonous
Matter that adher'd to them:
Insomuch that <span class="antiqua">Diemerbroek</span> accounts
it not only a Preservative,
but tells us, that himself, when
he was several times infected, by
taking five or six Pipes of Tobacco
together was presently cur'd. And
amongst us in <i>England</i> 'tis reported,
That in the last great Plague,
no Tobacco-Shop was infected:
If 'tis not of so great virtue still
amongst us, the reason is, because
most Men have been accustomed
to take it so excessively;
wherefore it is grown so familiar
to them, that it produceth no alteration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when it should be us'd as
an Antidote.</p>

<p>Besides the frequent use of Tobacco,
which doubtless in time of
Plague may be profitable for them
that can take it; others, and also Tobacconists,
at sometimes should be
furnished with something to smell
to when they pass through infected
Places. <i>Wormwood</i> and <i>Rue</i>, <i>Galbanum</i>,
<i>Castor</i> and <i>Vinegar</i> are good:
The vulgar practice of putting
<i>Mithridate</i>, or <i>Treacle</i>, or <i>Tar</i> in
their Nostrils, may be very useful;
or to have a <i>Pomander</i> to carry in
ones hand, or put into the top of
a Staff.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hangingindent"><i>Take of the Roots of</i> Contrayerva
<i>and</i> Virginian-Snakeweed
<i>pouder'd,<span class="pagenum smaller2"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of each Two Drams;
of the best</i> Myrrh <i>pouder'd,
half an Ounce; of</i>
Camphire <i>half a Dram.
Let it be made a Pouder</i>.</p></div>

<p>Part of this may be enclos'd in
a fine Silk Bag, and oftentimes
dip it in <i>Pestilential Vinegar</i>, and
so smell to it. To the other part of
this, add <i>Oyl of Nutmegs</i> by Expression,
and Oyl of <i>Cap-ivy</i>, of
each a Dram, or as much as will
make it into a Mass; also add
of <i>Balsam of Peru</i> one Scruple.
Dip Cotton Wool in <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Elixir Proprietatis</i>,
inclose it in fine Silk, and
put it in the head of a Staff, or
Civet Box, to smell to.</p>

<p>For Medicines to hold in the
Mouth, and chew on, Roots of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Zedoary</i>, <i>Contrayerva</i>, and <i>Snakeweed</i>
are very good; also Roots of
<i>Enulacampane</i>, <i>Angelica</i>, and <i>Masterwort</i>;
these either alone, or macerated
in <i>Vinegar</i>, and dried again.
<i>Myrrh</i> is very excellent:
Some commend Tobacco, and
chew it almost continually.</p>

<p>These are the chiefest Remedies
which help to keep Infection out
of the Body. There is yet another
sort which serves to let it out,
and carry it away, before it grows
to a head, <i>viz. Issues</i>, which have
been found by often experience
to be good Preservatives in time
of Plague: For as much as Nature
having a constant vent for
excrementitious matter thrown off
the Blood, by the same way expels
poysonous Atoms soon after
they are receiv'd into the Body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning Rules of Diet I
need not say much, because such
Precepts are commonly known:
'Tis to be observ'd in general, that
only wholsome Food should be
taken: Very salt Meats, as hang'd
Beef, Bacon, Pork, salt Fish, also
shell-Fish, most kind of Herbage
and raw Fruit should be avoided.
The Meals should be moderate,
and eaten in due season. Some
Antidotal Things may be taken
with the Meat, or mix'd in the
Sauce; <i>Clove Gilloflowers</i> pickled,
also <i>Citron</i> Peel and Juice,
<i>Rasberries</i>, <i>Currants</i>, <i>Pomegranate</i>
Juices, <i>Pestilential Vinegar</i>, and <i>Mustard</i>,
made with the Seeds of <i>Thlaspi</i>,
may be of some good effect.</p>

<p>These kind of Remedies, and
manner of living, ought chiefly
to be insisted on as Preservatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
against the Plague. Those that
are timorous and of tender Constitutions
require a support from
the use of more means; whereas
Persons that are strong, and of a
bold temper, have need of the less
Remedies. But 'tis not safe for any
to be so confident as to dare to
converse with infected People, or
live in the midst of Contagion
without any Antidote at all.</p>

<p>In the use of means, caution is
to be had, that strong and hot Cordials
be not too often taken, nor
yet indifferently by all People; for
that will inflame the Blood, and
make it apt to kindle a Fever, which
at such times soon turns to the
Plague.</p>

<p>The like caution is to be had
against immoderate drinking of
Wine; though a moderate proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
chears and fortifies the
Spirits, yet too much greatly disorders
them, and thereby People
are more expos'd to take Infection.</p>

<p>Letting of Blood in time of
Plague has been observ'd to be very
pernicious; so also oft or
strong Purging; for the Veins
being emptied either way, will
readily suck in whatever poysonous
Atoms lurk in the outward
Pores of the Body, which being
admitted, become the more prevalent,
because the Spirits being
depauperated, are less able to subdue
or repel them.</p>

<p>Thus much of the way of Preservation:
Next we are to treat
of the Cure of those that are infected.</p>

<p>The Cure of the Plague admits
of no Delay; neither indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is there need of any deliberation
what ought to be done;
but as soon as any one finds
himself infected, let him forthwith
take to his Bed, and having
pray'd to Almighty God for
his Blessing, begin to use the
Means.</p>

<p>If the Party is much oppress'd
at his Stomach, and strains to
vomit, or else with vomiting
throws up bitter and stinking
Matter; let him presently take
a large draught of <i>Carduus</i>, or
<i>Camomile</i> Posset-Drink, and in
it either half a Dram of Salt of
<i>Vitriol</i>, or two Ounces of Liquor
of <i>Squills</i>, and with his finger or
a Feather, fetch up what is contain'd
in his Stomach; but take
no Antimonial Medicine, that
will work beyond the Stomach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
As soon as he has vomited, [or if
there is no occasion for this Evacuation]
let him presently be
put into a Sweat, and continue
for twelve hours, more or less,
according as his strength will
hold out, and not sleep in
it, or not till the latter end
of it.</p>

<p>If when he begins to Sweat,
or endeavours it, his Vomiting
still persists, then apply to the
pit of the Stomach a Toast of
White-Bread, spread over with
<i>Treacle</i> or <i>Mithridate</i>, and dipt
in <i>Claret-Wine</i> or <i>Pestilential Vinegar</i>,
made Scalding hot in a
Peuter Dish; Wrap this in fine
Linnen, and apply it very hot.</p>

<p>After a plentiful Sweat for
twelve, fourteen, or eighteen
hours, give him some Refective,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as Broth, Caudle, Mace-drink, or
the like; and a little while after
suffer him to sleep if he can. Then
give him temperate Cordials by
way of Confection or Julep, or
both; which repeat every third or
fourth hour: Also at the time
that the Party settles to sleep, lay
<i>Vesicatory</i> Plaisters behind the Ears,
and under the Arm-pits, and also
in the Groin.</p>

<p>After he has slept, or endeavour'd
it, and his Spirits are pretty
well refresh'd, at a moderate
distance from the first sweating,
<i>viz.</i> Eighteen, or Four and Twenty
hours, sooner or later, according
as Symptoms are more or less
urgent, and his strength is able,
repeat the Sweating again; and
so proceed through the whole
Cure; one while Sweating, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
another while refreshing his Spirits
by temperate Cordials and
Sleep; betwixt whiles administring
fit Nourishment, until such
time as the Symptoms are abated
wholly, and either the Disease
terminated, or else the Malignity
is driven all out in Boyls or
Carbuncles; which how they
must be order'd, shall be set
down.</p>

<p>Though the same kind of Sudorificks
may be given indifferently
to most People, yet because
there is variety of such Medicines,
in respect both of the Matter
and Form of them, therefore
some choice may be had in the
administration of them, that so
we may comply with the Patient's
taking them best in this
or that kind of Form; and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that those that are hotter be
given to Persons of a cold Temper,
and those Medicines which
are more temperate to such whose
Constitutions are hot: I shall
set down several Forms of Sweating
Medicines, which are given
either in <span class="antiqua">Potion</span>, <span class="antiqua">Bolus</span>, or
<span class="antiqua">Pouder</span>.</p>

<p>Sometimes the Plague is accompanied
with dangerous Symptoms,
to which if Remedies are not suddenly
applied, all we do besides
is to little purpose. Such Accidents,
which call for respective
ways of Cure, are chiefly <i>Fluxes
of Blood</i>, and <i>Loosness of the Belly</i>,
and <i>Vomiting</i>.</p>

<p>The first use to happen several
ways, <i>viz.</i> at the Nose and
Mouth, by Stool or Urine, by
the <i>H&aelig;morrhoids</i>, and in Women
by Menstrual Purgations: Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of which, as by Urine always,
and ofttimes by Stool, are mortal;
none of them ever tend to
good. Therefore in all such cases,
Remedies must be administred
which may stop Bleeding: And
though Sweating and Refection of
the Spirits be still the principal
intention of Cure; yet the other
must come in as collateral with
both of them; and Medicines
that restrain Fluxes of Blood be
mixed both with Sudorificks and
other Cordials, and also be administred
with Diet too.</p>

<p>In all <i>H&aelig;morrhages</i> Sudorificks
must be compounded of Medicines
that are temperate, and not
astringent.</p>

<p>In the Cure of the Plague, if

do plentifully succeed,
and withal other private Excretions
be either prevented or presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
supprest, the Patient may
be judg'd to be in a hopeful
condition; and sometimes the
Venom is quite expell'd, without
any other accident: But for the
most part, because the Poyson,
by fermenting the Blood and
Humours, is soon greatly encreas'd;
so that all of it, especially
the grosser Particles, cannot
easily evaporate, it settles
in the outward Parts, and there
causeth the swelling and breaking
out of divers kinds: Those
that require any application of
Remedies, are <span class="antiqua">Boils</span> and <span class="antiqua">Carbuncles</span>.</p>

<p>The first of these commonly
happen in Parts that are very
Glandulous; as behind the Ears,
under the Armpits, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Groin: They arise with a hard
Swelling, which ought to suppurate
and break, and the Corruption
to be drawn all out, by
the running of the Sore for some
time: These Tumors call'd
<span class="antiqua">Bubo's</span>, should be ordered thus.</p>

<p>If a Blister is not rais'd on,
or near the place already, 'tis
good to apply a <i>Vesicatory</i> Plaister
just below it, but on the
Tumor it self to apply some
drawing Medicine, to attract the
Venom outward; as at first, the
Fundament of some living Fowl,
or else a <i>Colewort-Leaf</i> dipt in
scalding Water, and dried again,
and smear'd over with <i>Oyl of
Lillies</i> or <i>Scorpions</i>. To ripen
the Sore, lay on Pultises or Plaisters;
or rather first Pultises, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
then Plaisters, when it tends to
suppuration; which should be renew'd
every twelve hours at least.</p>

<p>For <span class="antiqua">Pultises</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If when the Tumor is ripen'd,

it is best to open it by Incision;

<p>A <span class="antiqua">Carbuncle</span>, which is the

It ariseth with angry <i>Pustules</i>,
sometimes one, sometimes many;
which soon grow discolour'd,

the substance mortified must
be cast out, and then the hollow
Ulcer which remains must be
healed.</p>

<p>When a <i>Carbuncle</i> first appears,
<span class="antiqua">Diemerbroek</span> commends to be
applied to it for the first and second
day, a <i>Red Colewort Leaf</i>,
smear'd over with <i>Rape Oyl</i>: The

which he us'd for the most part,
renewing it three or four times
in four and twenty hours, till the
